# Palindrome Checker

This is a simple project I completed as part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification on freeCodeCamp.
The goal of the project is to check if a given input is a palindrome.

## Introduction
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).
This project provides a function to check if the given input is a palindrome.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
